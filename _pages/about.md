I am a recent graduate of the MS in **Marketing Science** program at [Columbia Business School](https://business.columbia.edu/). I also hold a BBA in **Management Information Systems** with Honors and a BSA in **Mathematics** with Honors from [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). 

My research interests focus on **deriving strategic consumer insights from data**. I am passionate about the intersection of **technology, business, and society**. I want to explore how data can be ethically utilized to formulate strategies and inform decisions across a wide range of fields.
