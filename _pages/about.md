I am a recent graduate of the MS in Marketing Science program at Columbia Business School. I also hold a BBA in Management Information Systems with Honors and a BSA in Mathematics with Honors from the University of Texas at Austin. 

My research interests focus on deriving strategic insights from data, specifically exploring how data can be ethically utilized to formulate strategies and inform decisions across a wide range of fields. To further pursue this goal, I am eager to continue my academic journey by pursuing a doctoral degree in Information Systems, where I aspire to refine my interests and deepen my expertise in research methodologies. 

I am actively looking for research collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me - I am happy to chat about anything!
