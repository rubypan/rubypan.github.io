I am a recent graduate of the MS in **Marketing Science** program at [Columbia Business School](https://business.columbia.edu/). I also hold a BBA in **Management Information Systems** with Honors and a BSA in **Mathematics** with Honors from [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). 

My research interests focus on **deriving strategic insights from data**. I am passionate about exploring how data can be ethically utilized to formulate strategies and inform decisions across a wide range of fields. To further pursue this goal, I am eager to continue my academic journey by pursuing a doctoral degree in Information Systems, where I aspire to refine my interests and deepen my expertise in research methodologies. 

I am actively looking for research collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me - I am happy to chat about anything!
